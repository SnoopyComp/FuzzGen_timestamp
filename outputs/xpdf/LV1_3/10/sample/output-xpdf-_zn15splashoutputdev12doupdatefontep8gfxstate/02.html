<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt; // For memset
#include &lt;cstdint&gt; // For uint32_t

// Assuming GfxState is a defined class. A minimal definition is provided here for demonstration.
class GfxState {
public:
    // Example members for GfxState
    int fontSize;
    char fontName[50]; // Example for a font name

    GfxState() {
        // Initialize members
        fontSize = 12; // Default font size
        memset(fontName, 0, sizeof(fontName)); // Clear font name
    }

    void setFontSize(int size) {
        fontSize = size;
    }

    void setFontName(const char* name) {
        strncpy(fontName, name, sizeof(fontName) - 1);
        fontName[sizeof(fontName) - 1] = &#39;\0&#39;; // Ensure null-termination
    }
};

class SplashOutputDev {
public:
    void doUpdateFont(GfxState *state) {
        // Function implementation (for demonstration purposes)
        // In a real implementation, this would update the font based on the GfxState
        printf(&#34;Updating font: Size = %d, Name = %s\n&#34;, state-&gt;fontSize, state-&gt;fontName);
    }
};

// This function is the entry point for the fuzzer
extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

    // Create an instance of GfxState
    GfxState gfxState;

    // Use the fuzzed data to influence the GfxState
    int fontSize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange&lt;int&gt;(1, 100); // Random font size between 1 and 100
    gfxState.setFontSize(fontSize);

    // Consume a string from the fuzzed data for the font name
    std::string fontName = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(49); // Max length 49 to fit in the buffer
    gfxState.setFontName(fontName.c_str());

    // Create an instance of SplashOutputDev
    SplashOutputDev splashOutputDev;

    // Call the function under test
    splashOutputDev.doUpdateFont(&amp;gfxState);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
fuzz_zxdoc.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
In file included from fuzz_zxdoc.cc:2:
In file included from /usr/local/lib/clang/18/include/fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h:27:
/usr/local/bin/../include/c++/v1/vector:843:7: error: use of undeclared identifier &#39;__sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container&#39;
  843 |       __sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container(__beg, __end, __old_mid, __new_mid);
      |       ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the fixed code that addresses the build issues while maintaining the original structure. The main changes include ensuring that the necessary headers are included and correcting the format of the code. The error message regarding `__sanitizer_annotate_contiguous_container` is usually related to the sanitizers not being set up correctly, but we&#39;ll focus on ensuring the code itself is correct for fuzzing.

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt; // For memset
#include &lt;cstdint&gt; // For uint32_t
#include &lt;cstdio&gt; // For printf
#include &lt;string&gt; // For std::string
#include &lt;iostream&gt; // For std::cout

// Assuming GfxState is a defined class. A minimal definition is provided here for demonstration.
class GfxState {
public:
    // Example members for GfxState
    int fontSize;
    char fontName[50]; // Example for a font name

    GfxState() {
        // Initialize members
        fontSize = 12; // Default font size
        memset(fontName, 0, sizeof(fontName)); // Clear font name
    }

    void setFontSize(int size) {
        fontSize = size;
    }

    void setFontName(const char* name) {
        strncpy(fontName, name, sizeof(fontName) - 1);
        fontName[sizeof(fontName) - 1] = &#39;\0&#39;; // Ensure null-termination
    }
};

class SplashOutputDev {
public:
    void doUpdateFont(GfxState *state) {
        // Function implementation (for demonstration purposes)
        // In a real implementation, this would update the font based on the GfxState
        printf(&#34;Updating font: Size = %d, Name = %s\n&#34;, state-&gt;fontSize, state-&gt;fontName);
    }
};

// This function is the entry point for the fuzzer
extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

    // Create an instance of GfxState
    GfxState gfxState;

    // Use the fuzzed data to influence the GfxState
    int fontSize = stream.ConsumeIntegralInRange&lt;int&gt;(1, 100); // Random font size between 1 and 100
    gfxState.setFontSize(fontSize);

    // Consume a string from the fuzzed data for the font name
    std::string fontName = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(49); // Max length 49 to fit in the buffer
    gfxState.setFontName(fontName.c_str());

    // Create an instance of SplashOutputDev
    SplashOutputDev splashOutputDev;

    // Call the function under test
    splashOutputDev.doUpdateFont(&amp;gfxState);

    return 0;
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Include `&lt;cstdio&gt;`**: This header is included for the `printf` function used in `doUpdateFont`.
2. **Include `&lt;string&gt;`**: This header is included for using `std::string`.
3. **Fixed Formatting**: Removed the unnecessary `&lt;solution&gt;` tags and ensured the code is clean and ready for compilation.

This code should now compile correctly for fuzzing, assuming your environment has the necessary fuzzing libraries set up properly.
